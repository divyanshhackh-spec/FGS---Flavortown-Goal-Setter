# Project Goal Setter – Work Hours Calculator

This project is a **goal-setting tool** designed to help creators, developers, and students plan their daily working hours based on what they want to achieve or buy.

Instead of guessing how long a project might take, this tool gives a **clear breakdown of effort vs reward**.

##  What This Project Does

The Goal Setter helps you:
- Decide **what you want to achieve or buy**
- Calculate how many **cookies (points)** are required
- Estimate how many **total working hours** are needed
- Break that down into **average daily working hours**
- Adjust calculations based on **project level**:
  - Low level  
  - Average level  
  - Good level  

This makes goal planning more realistic and motivating.

##  How It Works (Concept)

1. User selects a goal or item  
2. System assigns required cookies  
3. Based on project difficulty, hours are calculated  
4. Tool shows:
   - Total hours required  
   - Daily average hours needed to reach the goal on time

##  Future Plans

- Add interactive inputs  
- Implement real-time calculations  
- Add progress tracking  
- Improve UI/UX  
- Possibly store user progress
